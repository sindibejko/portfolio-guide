# Capstone Project 
(🔗 [Repository Link]([https://github.com/sindibejko/thesis-oilpriceforecasting](https://github.com/sindibejko/Capstone-Project)))

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🛢 [AI-Driven Crude Oil Price Forecasting & Hedging]([https://github.com/sindibejko/thesis-oilpriceforecasting](https://github.com/sindibejko/Capstone-Project)) | May 2025 | Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Statsmodels | My Capstone project  focuses on forecasting Abu Dhabi Murban Crude Oil prices using ARIMA, LSTM, and Transformer models. The project evaluates each model's forecasting performance and tests its effectiveness in real-life hedging decision scenarios. It explores whether AI models can outperform human analysts in predicting oil prices and reducing risk for energy firms. |
